//Bubble sorting sorts multiple elements like array of integers/strings/characters either in ascending or descending manner.

let arr = [10, 5, 1, 12, 3];

//if bubble element is greater than its right element then swap them, else if the bubble element is not greater than its right element then pass the bubble element to its right element


Phase 1

let bubble element = 10

10,5,1,12,3
5,10,1,12,3
5,1,10,12,3
5,1,10,12,3 //Here we pass the bubble element from 10 to 12
Now 12 is greater than its right element so swap them
5,1,10,3,12  (Now 12 is at it s correct position)


Phase 2

Now bubble element = 5
5,1,10,3,12
1,5,10,3,12
Here the bubble element 5 is not greater than its right element 10 so we pass the bubble element from 5 to 10
1,5,10,3,12
1,5,3,10,12


Phase 3

Now bubble element = 1
1,5,3,10,12
Pass the bubble element from 1 to 5
1,5,3,10,12
Swapping
1,3,5,10,12


Phase 4

Now bubble element = 1
1,3,5,10,12
pass the bubble element from 1 to 3
1,3,5,10,12



Note ---> If you have n elements then you have n-1 phases

Yaha par phases ko outer loop control krega aur inner loop operations ko
